## 📊 Required Visuals (Advanced R Graphs)

You must include 3 graphs using real data:

> All graphs must:
> - Use **black backgrounds**
> - Be styled with **military-grade camouflage** tones
> - Include **double dotted white axis lines**
> - Have **source footnotes** and **clear legends**

---

### ✅ Graph 1: Inflation vs. Peso Devaluation Timeline (Argentina 2020–2025)

```r
# Use ggplot2, scales, theme customization
# Data from IMF or INDEC, monthly/quarterly granularity
````

---

### ✅ Graph 2: FDI Inflow as % of GDP (Argentina vs. Sweden vs. USA)

```r
# Use OECD or UNCTAD
# Camouflage fill for Argentina, tan for Sweden, dark olive for USA
# Annotate 2023–2024 post-reform shift

---

### ✅ Graph 3: GINI Coefficient Pre/Post Milei Deregulation

```r
# Plot time series for Argentina and Germany
# Black background with camouflage line color scheme
# Add annotations for key policy years
```

---

---

## ✅ Submission Can Be Used For

* University macroeconomics discussion
* GitHub README for AI/econ learning repo
